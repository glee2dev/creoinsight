## The Evolution of Web Architecture
Modern web architecture has evolved significantly over the past decade. With the advent of microservices, serverless computing, and edge networks, the way we build and deploy web applications has transformed dramatically.

### Traditional Architecture
In the early days of web development, monolithic architectures were the norm. Everything from the database to the user interface was tightly coupled into a single application.

### Modern Approaches
Today's web applications often employ a distributed architecture, with different components running as independent services. This approach offers several advantages:

- Better scalability and performance
- Improved fault isolation
- Greater flexibility in choosing technologies
- Easier maintenance and updates
