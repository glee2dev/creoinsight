      <h2>The Evolution of Web Architecture</h2>
      <p>Modern web architecture has evolved significantly over the past decade. With the advent of microservices, 
      serverless computing, and edge networks, the way we build and deploy web applications has transformed dramatically.</p>

      <h3>Traditional Architecture</h3>
      <p>In the early days of web development, monolithic architectures were the norm. Everything from the database 
      to the user interface was tightly coupled into a single application.</p>

      <h3>Modern Approaches</h3>
      <p>Today's web applications often employ a distributed architecture, with different components running as 
      independent services. This approach offers several advantages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Better scalability and performance</li>
        <li>Improved fault isolation</li>
        <li>Greater flexibility in choosing technologies</li>
        <li>Easier maintenance and updates</li>
      </ul>
